            <p>
                for context:<br/><br/>
                this page was entirely made for fun, for me to try out and replicate the straw page gimmicks myself.
                <br/>
                my question to the people who tried to let me know:<br/>
                why are you just trying to ruin my mood?<br/>
                why are you just fucking around in something you shouldn't?<br/>
                why are you messing and tinkering and experimenting with a personal website?<br/>
                why the fuck are you even here?<br/>
                what was your fucking goal?<br/>
                was it to just fuck with me?<br/>
                to laugh and say "haha she doesn't know it's a bad thing to do"?<br/>
                did you know that i already knew all about this?<br/>
                i knew about all of this shit already and just didn't EVER have the time nor motivation nor saw the real need to do anything about it.<br/>
                i knew all well that anyone could have just taken a copy of all the gimmicks for themselves.<br/>
                <br/>
                have you ever heard about being busy? having something else to do?<br/>
                im sure you haven't because why else would you fucking mess with this page, huh?<br/>
                move on with your day please.<br/>
                <br/>
                - sincerely, mad violet at 2am, because you fuckers won't give me a break.<br/>
